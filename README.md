# Switch-HH-Simulations

This repository contains Python implementations of various heavy-hitter detection algorithms for programmable switches.
The algorithms include:
- CMSIS
- FCM
- FCM+TopK
- PRECISION
- HashPipe
- Count-Min

The performance of the algrothims is evaluated based on different metrics including Recall, Precision, F1-Score, FPR, FNR and MSE.
